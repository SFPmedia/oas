      <p>
        On this page, you will find a list of outdoor activities, with some of
        the most appropriate information available. <br />
        Google Maps is not always the best at distinguishing between outdoor
        activities and just places where you can do physical activities in
        general. <br />
        So I took the liberty of sorting through the list myself, in order to
        give a clear and accessible idea of the options near you.
